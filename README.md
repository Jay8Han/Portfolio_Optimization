# Portfolio Weighting Optimization

Overview:

This project explores portfolio diversification by combining equities with commodity futures. The analysis focuses on constructing a correlation matrix, visualizing the Markowitz Efficient Frontier, and identifying the optimal portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio.

The project is designed to help investors understand how commodities can enhance diversification and improve risk-adjusted returns when added to traditional equity portfolios.

Features:

Processes raw futures data into continuous contracts based on trading volume.

Computes daily returns and correlation matrices.

Implements Markowitz Efficient Frontier for portfolio optimization.

Run Monte Carlo simulations to Identify the optimal portfolio weights that maximize Sharpe ratio.

Visualizes results with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (Screenshot of interactive graphs are included in the Image folder).
